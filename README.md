# signup-form

This is a mock sign up page. The purpose of this project was to practice and test creating forms with multiple input fields and labels and styling the form, along with the rest of the page, with new CSS skills. The name, email, and password fields are required, with pattern validations. The "Create Account" submit button will not allow the form to be submitted without passing the validations.

Since this is a mock pack, please do not submit any personal information!
